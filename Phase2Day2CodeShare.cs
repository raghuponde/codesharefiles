Now i am opening yesterdays program only of MVCDemo1 so you also open yesterdays project as i am adding some small code in it 

Now what i want to do is in a single view means in a single page of design i want to use muliple models earleir i used either single model or colllection of same model 
but i have not used multiple models in the same page of .cshmtl so let us do that 

There will be situation where for generating reports you may need data from multiple models as all data is not present in single model .
