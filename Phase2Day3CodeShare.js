Redux in React
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps manage application state in a predictable manner by using a centralized store.

Why Use Redux?
Reactâ€™s built-in state management works well for small applications, but as the app grows, managing shared state between multiple components can become complex. Redux provides:

A single source of truth (centralized state)
Predictable state updates using pure functions (reducers)
Easier debugging with tools like Redux DevTools
Scalability for large applications
