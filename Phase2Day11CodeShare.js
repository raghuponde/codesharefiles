The important points 
---------------------------
using useSate u have to create controlled components in the design 

using props u have to pass values from dashboard to child components which it is holding here they are not using router if u keep sub elelemts in main container and if i show that main 
container which is nothing but dashboard then no need of router 

every component check what it is taking from service and that only u implment it there and pass as context sometimes all it will not export only few it will export and some to other components okay 

first go and write reducer code in service file and then go with context 

in components first desing u do it and later on write other codes 

check test file and according  to  that do desing 

In the dashboard check what components has to be displayed and from dashboad u will only have to send it by props and go to components and see { what they are taking that only send it in dashboard }

make your familair with writing arrow function and map and filter which are used extensively here 




In category list u are doing both adding and deleting 


but  in Tasklist for adding taskinput.js is there and for  and for siaplying tasklist it can be divided 

you should know how to toggle the design  using useState and it done using ternary operator ? true means first value or secod value 

but when it is null value in useState it is reverse means if   ? true means not null so firt will be displayed otherwise second will be desilayed
