Go to the project which i had done yesterday Day12  on web api implementing identity with token and also take the front end from day 10 and try to connect 
from front end to back end 

so i am getting this error 

Request failed with status code 401
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 401

I will not get this error if in the back end I remove authorised attribute So so now If to access with Authorize attibute controlelr u 
  have to write a  code or design for Auth  Controller I am having design for student controller only 

so go to chatgpt and tell 

for student controler in react i am mainting this code 

---->paste StudentService code with heading so that it knows what you are typing now 

---->Paste next studnet form and studentlist and App.js codes 

after pasting all code with proper headings write like this 

so this react code for the student web api now for this which u have given Authcontroller  i want code for that in react and it should connect studnet controller so i shoudl be able to logn and do register and in servcie chaneg the code as per authetication and authorization

Here AuthContoller code i had done by taking the help of chat gpt so i had written like that 

otherwise what u can do is 

  or 

Take all web api code including the fron end react code paste it and tell that for AuthContoller in the web api i want react code for that which is not 
there it should connect studnet controller so i shoudl be able to logn and do register and in service change the code as per authetication and authorization

Then chatgpt some ouptut put it and execute the code 

so now i am putting that code one by one and i will explain that code 

so u can see i cannot touch web api I am getting 401 error what to do let us start
