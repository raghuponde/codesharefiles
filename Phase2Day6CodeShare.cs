Code First Approach
***********************
The C# classes (models) are created first.
EF generates the corresponding database and tables based on these classes.
Uses Migrations to update the database schema.

  When to use?

---->When you want full control over your database structure.
---->When starting a new project from scratch.

  you will only generate the database from the front end into the database server 
  means you will follow some steps to do that
